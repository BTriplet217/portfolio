        <p style="font-size:15px">For many years, this was the best image we had of my grandfather, who was killed when my dad was ten. After the death of my uncle last year, I was able to get a good digital copy of the image, so I could get to work on getting a perfect image for my father, aunts and uncles to have of their father. <br><br>I used Photoshop for this task, using the clone tool, patch tool, and even the drawing tools to make the lines more defined. Upon showing my dad the finished piece, he asked if color was a possibility. I used the colorize function for this, not because I can't paint it in, but because I knew the colors would be more accurate.</p>

        <p style="font-size:15px">I restored this image for an individual on a free edits group on Facebook. Typically, I find myself scrolling through and not really interacting. Occasionally, there is one that hurts your heart, and you can't help but give it a shot. This person lost everything in a fire, and was asking to fix the one image she was able to salvage. <br><br> Like the one with my grandfather, I had to do quite a bit of guesswork, and piece things together with clone tool, patching, and some painting. Upon completion, this is the result I got. The individual was very thankful, and she was more than happy to allow me to use this image for my portfolio.</p>
